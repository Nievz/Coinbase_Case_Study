# Coinbase a Case Study

## Overview and Origin

Coinbase Global, Inc., better known simply as Coinbase, is a publicly traded company based in the United States that runs an exchange platform for cryptocurrencies. 

According to the volume of trades conducted on its platform, it is the most important cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. 

In 2012, Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam established the company.  

Brian Armstrong, a former engineer at Airbnb, recently joined the Y Combinator startup incubator program and was awarded a cash infusion of US$150,000 as a result of his participation. 

Armstrong's posts on Reddit caught the attention of Fred Ehrsam, a former trader at Goldman Sachs, who eventually became a co-founder of the company.

## Business Activities

Coinbase caters to both individual and institutional investors in cryptocurrencies by providing a range of investment options, as well as other products related to the sector.

Coinbase Prime is a trading platform designed specifically for institutional customers, and Coinbase Custody is a custody solution. Both of these products are aimed at institutional traders.

Coinbase also offers solutions for retail merchants which includes:

A mobile application that allows users to buy, store, and trade various cryptocurrencies. 

A specialized asset trading platform that allows users to trade digital currencies.

Customers can use a decentralized application browser to access the Coinbase Wallet app, which is a decentralized cryptocurrency application (dapp) browser.

## Landscape

Customers of the digital stablecoin known as USD Coin are given the opportunity to trade in their U.S. dollars for a cryptocurrency that maintains the same value but can be transacted with at a faster rate.

Customers can make purchases with cryptocurrency using the Coinbase Card, which is a debit Visa card.

Coinbase Earn is a cryptocurrency learning platform that allows users to earn small amounts of alternative cryptocurrencies for participating in educational activities such as watching videos and taking quizzes.

Transaction fees, which are incurred whenever a user buys or sells cryptocurrencies on the Coinbase platform, are the primary source of revenue for Coinbase.

Other sources of revenue include commissions from customers who hold cryptocurrency after a transaction has been processed, fees from credit card transactions and debit card transactions, conversion of cryptocurrency to fiat currency, and credit card transaction fees.

Market capitalization-wise, Coinbase is far ahead of the competition at $17.628 billion. Most of Coinbase's competition comes from Binance, but Kraken, Crypto.com, Robinhood, and Gemini are also in the game.

## Results

Coinbase's ability to drive value can be seen in The term "Coinbase Effect" which refers to a phenomenon that causes the value of assets to increase whenever new listings are published. 

When a cryptocurrency is listed on prominent exchanges, it gains instant access to a new group of market players. This is the economic rationale that underpins the impact.  

Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) reported revenue of $629.11 million for the quarter that ended in December 2022. 

This represents a decrease of 74.8% compared to the same period last year. When compared to the previous year's same quarter's results of $3.32, EPS came in at a negative $2.46.

The cryptocurrency economy is characterized by a market that is both extremely fragmented and intensely competitive. 

Coinbase is up against competition from both large and well-established financial institutions as well as newer, smaller startups in their early stages. 

Users will not find a solution that is universally applicable because the market is decentralized. 

The various exchanges each cater to a distinct set of requirements and provide their own distinctive value proposition.

## Recommendations

There are numerous ways to pay for cryptocurrencies on Coinbase, and the fees can sometimes be difficult to comprehend. 

Even though Coinbase discloses users of fees before they complete a transaction, it is difficult to find them beforehand. 

This can be problematic for individuals who are seeking their first exchange and are concerned with fees. Overall, some competitors' prices are lower than those of others. 

By reducing their rates, making their rates comparable to those of other platforms, and educating new users.  

Coinbase would be able to maintain the lowest possible level of acquisition costs while still fostering an ever-expanding community of devoted customers if it utilized this model for the process of acquiring new customers. 

This could be achieved by lowering their rates and putting more effort into educating first-time customers.

Coinbase could provide new consumers with a seamless experience while taking steps to secure their operating environment. 

Coinbase benefits from AI and the deployment of a machine learning-driven system that identifies mismatches and anomalies in user identification sources, allowing them to swiftly respond to potential sources of fraud.
